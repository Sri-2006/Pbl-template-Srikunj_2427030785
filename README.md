Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are widely deployed for seabed mapping, infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and scientific exploration. Despite significant advances in autonomy and control, mission endurance remains fundamentally constrained by onboard battery capacity. Unlike terrestrial or aerial robots, AUVs operate in a high-drag, energy-intensive environment where hydrodynamic resistance and ocean currents significantly influence power consumption. Existing path planning algorithms for AUVs primarily optimize geometric distance or travel time, without explicitly accounting for hydrodynamic drag forces or spatially varying ocean current fields. In real underwater operations, currents can either assist or oppose vehicle motion, thereby substantially altering propulsion power requirements. As a result, shortest-path trajectories are not necessarily energy-optimal, and time-optimal paths may incur excessive power consumption, reducing mission endurance and operational coverage. Moreover, most classical planners assume static environments or neglect energy-aware cost formulations that incorporate vehicle dynamics and environmental disturbances. There is limited research on integrating hydrodynamic energy models directly into graph-based path planning frameworks in a computationally efficient manner suitable for embedded AUV systems.

Literature Review
Recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) span energy systems, control, perception, communication, and multi-vehicle coordination. Wireless power transfer architectures now enable rotation-insensitive autonomous docking with >92% efficiency, reducing reliance on precise mechanical alignment but requiring real-world seawater validation. Reconfigurable morphing platforms optimize hydrodynamic efficiency for transit and maneuverability for inspection, albeit with increased mechanical complexity and energy trade-offs. Robust control strategies—including tube-based nonlinear model predictive control, sliding mode control, and time-optimal heading control with disturbance observers—provide stability guarantees under bounded uncertainties, though many remain simulation-validated and computationally demanding. Reinforcement learning approaches improve underwater optical communication alignment and adaptive autonomy, demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer but requiring substantial training effort. Vision-based frameworks combining underwater image enhancement and deep learning enable high-accuracy onboard object detection within embedded constraints. Comprehensive reviews highlight emerging directions such as biomimetic propulsion, advanced energy storage, hybrid acoustic-optical networking, and swarm coordination. Multi-AUV distributed formation control with minimal communication further supports scalable deployments. Collectively, these works advance persistent, autonomous, and cooperative underwater operations while underscoring enduring constraints in energy density, communication bandwidth, computational load, and field validation.

Innovation
Spatially varying ocean currents can significantly alter energy-optimal trajectories, and classical shortest-path planning may result in substantial energy inefficiency. Develop and validate an energy-aware path planning framework for AUVs operating under spatially varying ocean currents, and demonstrate performance gains over conventional shortest-path and time-optimal planners.
